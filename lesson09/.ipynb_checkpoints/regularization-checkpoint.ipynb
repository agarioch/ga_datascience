    "### The goal of regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of \"regularizing\" regression models is to structurally prevent overfitting, \"learning too much noise\", by imposing a penalty on the coefficients of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization artificially discourages complex or extreme explanations of the world even if they fit the what has been observed better. The idea is that such explanations are unlikely to generalize well to the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization methods like the Ridge and **Lasso** add this additional \"penalty\" on the size of coefficients to the loss function. When the loss function is minimized, this additional component is added to the residual sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the minimization becomes a balance between the error between predictions and true values and the size of the coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common types of regularization are the **Lasso**, **Ridge**. There is a mixture of them called the **Elastic Net**. We will take a look at the mathematics of regularization and the effect these penalties have on model fits.\n",

    "### High dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is **approximately linear**, the least squares estimates will have **low bias**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If **n >> p**, where n is the number of observations and p is the number of features,then the least squares estimates tend to also have **low variance**, and hence they will perform well on the test observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **if n is not much larger than p**, then there can be a lot of variability in the least squares fit, resulting in **overfitting** and poor test performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constraining or shrinking the estimated coefficients, we can often substantially reduce the variance of our model at the cost of a negligible increase in bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a **bonus**, if that shrinkage can take the coefficients to zero, then we can also reduce the model complexity and make inference easier. "

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Collinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Colinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related to one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of collinearity can pose problems in the regression context, since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear variables on the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of high dimensionality, the problem of collinearity can grow to extreme levels, in which we can't really know which variables explain the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The side effect of high collinearity in our models is that we tend to overestimate the effect of particular features, and hence the coefficient values tend to be bigger.\n",
    "Regularisation can help by reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and also by shriking the coefficient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can no longer interpret a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one unit increase in that variable holding the other variables constant. This is because when predictors are strongly correlated, there is not a scenario in which one variable can change without a conditional change in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Lasso is particularly useful when you have redundant or unimportant variables.** If you have 1000 variables in a dataset the Lasso can perform \"feature selection\" automatically for you by forcing coefficients to be zero."
