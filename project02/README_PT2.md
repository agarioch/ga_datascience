# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project, Part 2: EDA + Initial Models.

### PROMPT

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial and informative step in the data process. It helps confirm or deny your initial hypotheses and helps visualize the relationships among your data. Your exploratory analysis also informs the kinds of data transformations that you'll need to optimize for machine learning models.

In this assignment, you will describe your data, the type of prediction problem that you want to solve. You will also explore and visualize your initial analysis in order to effectively tell your data's story. You'll create an iPython notebook that explores your data mathematically, using a python visualization package.

Finally you will also start training your initial models (including calculating the baseline), to create the appropiate feedback loop for your analysis.

### DELIVERABLES

#### Project Design Writeup

- **Requirements:**
    - Well-articulated problem statement with "specific aim" and hypothesis, based on your PT1 submission.
    - An outline of any potential methods and models
    - Detailed explanation of extant data available (ie: build a data dictionary or link to pre-built data dictionaries)
    - Describe any outstanding questions, assumptions, risks, caveats
    - Demonstrate domain knowledge, including specific features or relevant benchmarks from similar projects 
    - Define your goals and criteria, in order to explain what success looks like

#### Exploratory Analysis Writeup

- **Requirements:**
   * Review the data set and project with an EIR during office hours.
   * Practice importing (potentially unformatted) data into clean matrices|data frames, and if necessary, export into a form that makes sense (text files or a database, for example).
   * Explore the mathematical properties and visualize data through a python visualization tool (matplotlib and seaborn)
   * Provide insight about the data set and any impact on a hypothesis.
   * Summarise the main findings of the EDA process. Any interesting patterns? Potential pitfalls?

### Inital modelling.

- **Requirements:**
   * Create an initial Feature Matrix.
   * Decide how you will assess your model (train/test split or cross validation).
   * Calculate your baseline model and the baseline error metric.
   * Fit at least one model using all your features and evaluate it's performance.
   * Summarise your initial results.

### Assessment

This submission will be marked on a four point scale for each item and feedback will be provided for each:

0 - Doesn't meet expectations

1 - Partially meets expectations

2 - Meets expectations

3 - Exceeds expectations
zz
The items to be assessed are:

* EDA - coding
* EDA - methodology
* EDA - conceptual understanding

* Initial Models - coding
* Initial Models - methodology
* Initial Models - conceptual understanding

As always, the key aspect in the assessment is to provide feedback for improvement and clarification.
